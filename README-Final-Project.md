# Final Project

The final project is an opportunity to use the ideas from this course for exploring interesting data science problems.
You will work on the project in a group of four. 

## Basketball

NBA website provides many different types of data. Some project ideas are:

Exploring feature engineering for basketball data:   
NBA website [glossary](http://stats.nba.com/help/glossary/) offers many engineered features. For example, search for `DEFRTG`. Are these useful for discrimination or prediction?
What features seem to discriminate a class label? e.g., wins vs. losses, home game vs. away game, defensive player vs. offensive player, etc.
Can you design your useful features? Can you show that your features are useful qualitatively? quantitatively?
You also build classification models using your new features
  
## Portfolio Optimization

Minimum variance portfolio selection problem was discussed in a naive setting to illustrate the theory. 
Using the theory in practice, however, requires a more sophisticated approach. 
For example, since real financial market is not stationary, portfolio weights needs to be recomputed periodically (called rebalancing).
Costs associated with trades need to be included in the calculation: borrowing cost, transaction cost, etc.
For reference, you can refer to Appendix J in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5381) for details. 
A pre-built package that powers a quantitative trading strategy site is [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/home).
They release a package that powers [their site](http://www.zipline.io/). The package takes care of the details. 
Refer to some examples [here](http://www.zipline.io/beginner-tutorial.html).  
A project idea is to tackle minimum variance portfolio investment strategy with Zipline.

## Health data 

[NHANES dataset](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes_questionnaires.htm) is a vast resource of open health datasets.
You can extend the health data module for your project.

## Yelp 

In later part of the course, we will use Yelp reviews to work with text data. 
You can consider doing a project using text data. Python has a wealth of packages for working with text data. 
Even with simple tools, one can do a lot with text. Here is the link to a good [online resource](https://ucsb-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01UCSB_ALMA51279011670003776&context=L&vid=UCSB&search_scope=default_scope&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US).

## Your project

You can work on your own project. Please discuss your idea with me, so that I can help you get started and make sure the scope is reasonable.
